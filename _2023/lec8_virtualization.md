## 1. Introduction

How to build and maintain software at scale has become one of the most
important problems in software engineering in the last few years. The internet
has only grown at huge pace, and the landscape looks very different to how it
might have used to only a few decades ago. The industry has very heavily
adopted using virtual machines (virtualization) and containers
(containerization) to help manage this new complexity.

What specific problems are we trying to solve?

- Building for a cloud-native landscape.

  With the cloud business growing, companies are left with attempting to
  efficiently split up and sell huge data centers to lots of different
  customers. Very few customers can (or even want to) rent 100+ core machines
  with thousands of GBs of RAM - we want to trade in much smaller units, and be
  more cost-efficient.

- Scaling up and out.

  Internet traffic is pretty variable - a website might go from near zero
  activity to absolutely heaving in hours. We want to built sites that can
  scale with traffic, easily adding new machines to handle the traffic. Cloud
  providers can help us here, but our software still needs to be split into
  composable units.

- Easier reproducible development.

  The "works on my machine" problem is really quite miserable. Containers and
  VMs let us create near-identical development and production environments. We
  can write code that compiles in a reproducible way, and deploy/test it with a
  consistent operating system and libraries.

To do this, the core idea of containers and virtual machines is to

> Split up our big computers into smaller computers

In doing this:

- We don't have to rent/buy huge machines to run lightweight applications
- We can easily to add more machines that are running our applications, since
  we create reproducible templates
- We don't have to worry about different dev+prod environments. This also helps
  break down the barrier between development and operations - nowadays we often
  merge the role into one DevOps role.

### Containerization vs Virtualization

While both of these technologies are about splitting up a big computer into
lots of little ones, with lots of similar principles, there are some
difference.

To cover the similarities:

- We create containers/VMs from reproducible templates (which we call "images")
- Each container/VM sees itself at the center of the world - even though there
  are other containers/VMs alongside them, they are isolated from each other.
- Both can be resource-limited to less than the amount that the host
  machine actually has.
- Both can be treated as a form of security-boundary to prevent access to the
  host or other peers [^1].

There's really only one main difference in the techniques: how do you actually
perform the isolation?

- Virtual machines are isolated from the host machine and each other (usually)
  at the hardware level. Modern instruction sets (like x86/arm/etc) have
  support for creating virtual machines. Each virtual machine sees itself as
  it's own machine, guaranteed by the hardware.

- Containers are isolated by utilizing low-level primitives in the
  operating-system (usually Linux) kernel [^2]. The kernel provides abstractions
  for isolating processes from each other, called namespaces, and mechanisms
  for controlling access to shared resources.

That's the main difference, but this has some big implications on what they up
looking like:

- Containers generally run a whole lot faster that virtual machines. We're
  seperating less out, and we don't need to run multiple operating systems, so
  we generally have a lot less overhead.
- Container images tend to be a lot smaller. We don't need to ship things like
  drivers or operating systems around (which can be massive).
- Because of these, it's really easy to spin up *tons* of containers - this is
  nice for creating local dev environments, but also for facilitating entirely
  new modes of engineering. We can split all of our services into separate
  components, and manage them all separately - which we call **microservices**.

Some common software for virtualization:
- VirtualBox, VMWare, QEMU, firecracker
vs some common software for containerization:
- Docker, podman, containerd via CRI-O

## 2. Technical details

> **Note**

### Virtualization

Generally, operating systems rely on features of the underlying hardware to
protect themselves and isolate their processes from each other. For example,
the operating system is allowed to configure page tables for each application
(this is completely contrived lol):

- We might put our code in `0x0000`-`0x1000`
- We might put our stack at `0x5000`-`0x7000`
- We might put our general-purpose heap at `0xa000`-`0xc000`

But importantly! An application isn't allowed to modify it's own page tables -
it has to ask it's *supervisor* (the operating system) to do this.

So how is this enforced?

- The supervisor runs in "ring 0" or "el1" or whatever your architecture says.
- The supervisor configures interrupts, that will wait for some trigger to
  happen (like "some time has passed").
- The supervisor drops priviledges down to the application level "ring 3" or
  "el0" (yes, depending on architecture, this number is completely arbitrary
  and can go in either direction, have fuuuun).
- The supervisor maps memory, etc, and then transfers control to the
  applications (usually with a `jmp` instruction or something).
- The application gets to do whatever it wants - until a trigger happens, and
  then it's forcible stopped, and control is returned to the supervisor - which
  gets put back in it's elevated priviledge.

Virtualization just extends this by adding *more levels* (or virtual levels).
Now, the supervisor is managed by the *hypervisor*, in *exactly* the same way
really.

### Containerization

Containerization just at the supervisor level, managing applications. But to
provide isolation, we need to use capabilities built into the linux kernel,
called namespaces.

Namespaces are hilariouly complicated (`man 7 namespaces`). But generally, each
namespace groups a set of resources: from within a namespace, processes see a
different view of the world.

For example, one of the most interesting resources to isolate is the view of
the directory hierarchy - starting at `/`, and covering the installed software
in `/bin`, and the user files in `/home`. To do this, we use the "mount
namespace". In linux, mounts are what goes into the directory hierarchy:

- We might mount an ext4 filesystem on a block device (like a hard drive) to `/`
- We might mount an xfs filesystem on a network device (like some network
  attached storage) to `/home` to let users access their home directory from
  any computer in a network.
- We also have a ton of *weird* mounts:
  - A temporary filesystem mounted directly in RAM at `/tmp`
  - A magical filesystem called `procfs` mounted at `/proc` - this is insanely
    cool, you can use this to see all the mounts in your filesystem using
    `cat /proc/self/mountinfo`.
  - Bind mounts, which create a "mirror" - you might bind mount `/usr/bin` to
    `/bin`, so that every change in `/bin` is mirrored to `/usr/bin` and
    vice-versa.

But, if a container can access the same files as the host then there's not a
lot of isolation... this is what mount namespaces are for! The docker daemon
(or other software) will create a mount namespace, and then choose it's own
view of what should be part of it - we could choose entirely different things
to mount, or we could mirror parts of the host system. This way `/` outside of
the container can have *entirely* different contents than `/` in the container!

Linux lets us namespace **lots** of things. Just to name a few:
- Mount namespaces, like we discussed above
- PID namespaces. Each running process in Linux gets a PID, and these start
  from 1, and go up. Each container should see it's own set of PIDs, so PID
  namespaces let us do that.
- Network namespaces. Containers should see different network devices, and have
  different IP addresses, etc. This is what lets us connect containers to each
  other, and have software-defined networks!
- User namespaces (more experimental, these are called root-less containers).
  Each container should be able to run as root - so that it can do all the
  things that the root user needs to be able to do, but we don't usually want
  these to be the "actual" root user.
- So many more, that I really do not know the details of.

### A small security note

This kind of isolation is very difficult to get correct. You should probably
*not* try to do it yourself, and make sure to rely on tools like docker which
have done the hard work for you.

That said, VM/container escapes *do* happen - if you end up in the unfortunate
position of needing to build an application that runs user-controlled code by
design, containers are often not accepted as an appropriate security boundary,
and usually VMs are relied on (but even then you can still get into trouble).

## 3. How does docker work?

The most well-known and widely-used container software is Docker - confusingly,
Docker is both a set of open source tool for building, running, sharing and
deploying containers as well as well as a company building paid products around
this.

Some core ideas of Docker:

- Containers are little isolated environments for running your applications
  (websites, databases, file stores, caching, etc).
- Containers can be created from images (templates for a container).
- Images are shared via registries (often Docker Hub at [docker.io](https://docker.io)).
- Images can be built from `Dockerfile`s, which are recipes for building images.

### Installing docker

There's a couple ways of installing Docker on Linux:

- Using your distro's package manager. However, this generally isn't fully
  up-to-date with upstream development.
- Use Docker's instructions at <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>. These
  *very closely* follow upstream.

For Windows and Mac OS, your options are more limited. A few suggestions:

- Use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (a
  closed-source product from Docker)
- Use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (only for
  Windows)
- Use [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima)/Colima (only for MacOS)

You should probably make sure you have a working docker installation before
moving on.

## 4. Hitchhiker's guide to Docker

Docker has two components - a daemon (`dockerd`) that runs in the background of
your machine, and a client that you use to connect to it (`docker`). You
usually won't need to interact directly with the daemon, and will just use the
`docker` command for everything.

### Pulling an image

Let's start by pulling a pre-built image with [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_pull/).
We'll choose `alpine` (a popular choice, it's known for being very small and
minimal):

    $ docker pull alpine
    Using default tag: latest
    latest: Pulling from library/alpine
    4abcf2066143: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:c5b1261d6d3e43071626931fc004f70149baeba2c8ec672bd4f27761f8e1ad6b
    docker.io/library/alpine:latest

We can list our images with [`docker images`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_ls/):

    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY                    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    alpine                        latest    05455a08881e   42 hours ago   7.37MB

We can get some information about our image (and pretty much any docker "object") using
[`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/):

    $ docker inspect alpine
    [
        {
            "Id": "sha256:05455a08881ea9cf0e752bc48e61bbd71a34c029bb13df01e40e3e70e0d007bd",
            "RepoTags": [
                "alpine:latest"
            ],
            "RepoDigests": [
                "alpine@sha256:c5b1261d6d3e43071626931fc004f70149baeba2c8ec672bd4f27761f8e1ad6b"
            ],
            "Parent": "",
            "Comment": "",
            "Created": "2024-01-27T00:30:48.743965523Z",
            ...
        }
    ]

### Running a container

Now that we've got our container image, we can run something in it using
[`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_run/)!
Let's try running an simple `echo` command:

    $ docker run alpine "Hello, world!"
    Hello, world!

Let's do something a little bit more complicated - we'll start a shell `sh`,
and run a few commands with it:

    $ docker run -it alpine sh
    # echo foo
    foo
    # echo bar
    bar
    # exit

> **Note**
>
> See the `-it` argument? From `man 1 docker-run`:
>
> > -i, --interactive=true|false
> >    Keep STDIN open even if not attached. The default is false.
>
> > -t, --tty=true|false
> >    Allocate a pseudo-TTY. The default is false.
>
> You can try running a container shell without either of these to see what
> happens! Without `-i`, we can't send any input into the running shell, and
> without `-t`, we won't allocate a TTY, so it won't behave like a normal
> terminal.

If we run [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_ls/)
in another terminal while we're doing this, we can see the container we just
created:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS             PORTS     NAMES
    76e8e3850508   alpine                             "sh"                     4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds                 pensive_haibt

Once the container stops, it'll disappear from `docker ps`.

Let's do something that's a bit more realistic though. Let's start a web
server, we'll use `nginx`. This time, we won't connect input, but we'll start
it running in the background with `-d` (for `d`etach), and with `-p` (for
`p`ort) to map port `80` in the container to port `8000` on our host.

    $ docker run -d -p 8000:80 nginx
    f38152075091fb62e0d17b68f88f7026bdc0a37f1429ab3ee9f8e74b8bb03f46

Once this starts up, we can connect to our custom web server (we could use a
web browser, but let's use curl):

    $ curl http://localhost:8000
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    <style>
    html { color-scheme: light dark; }
    body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
    font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    working. Further configuration is required.</p>

    <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    Commercial support is available at
    <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
    </body>
    </html>

Let's support we want to see into our logs for our running container - maybe
something isn't working. For this, we can use [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_logs/)
using the ID/name of our container:

    $ docker logs f38152075091fb62e0d17b68f88f7026bdc0a37f1429ab3ee9f8e74b8bb03f46

    ...


When we're done with our server, we can stop it using [`docker stop`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/):

    $ docker stop f38152075091fb62e0d17b68f88f7026bdc0a37f1429ab3ee9f8e74b8bb03f46
    f38152075091fb62e0d17b68f88f7026bdc0a37f1429ab3ee9f8e74b8bb03f46

If we do our `curl` again, the server will have stopped, so it should fail now:

    $ curl http://localhost:8000
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server

## 5. Building images

So, we've had a bit of a play around with running pre-built images. And this
work for running pre-packaged applications: databases, webservers, open-source
software, etc. But we also want to package our own software!

Building our own images is usually done from a `Dockerfile` [^3]. A `Dockerfile`
is pretty much *the simplest* format you could imagine - each line has a
command on it, and the builder runs each command one at a time, to put together
the container image.

For example, let's suppose I want to extend our web server to display a custom
page:

    $ ls my-content
    index.html
    $ cat my-content/index.html
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is a test page</p>
      </body>
    </html>

I can write a `Dockerfile` to do this:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
COPY my-content /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Let's build that: for this we use [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_build/):

    $ docker build -t myserver .
    [+] Building 1.1s (7/7) FINISHED
     => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
     => => transferring dockerfile: 86B
     => [internal] load .dockerignore
     => => transferring context: 2B
     => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/nginx:latest
     => [internal] load build context
     => => transferring context: 89B
     => [1/2] FROM docker.io/library/nginx
     => [2/2] COPY my-content /usr/share/nginx/html
     => exporting to image
     => => exporting layers
     => => writing image sha256:9cfbc1bad1906bf48ebfe659c4aa68b14c64c433a5040ae2f83b32f75e13ce73
     => => naming to docker.io/library/myserver

Now, if we run `docker images`, we can see the result in there:

    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY                     TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    myserver                       latest            9cfbc1bad190   25 seconds ago   187MB

Let's spin up and run our server, and do another `curl`:

    $ docker run -d -p 8000:80 myserver
    98f8b9e842e2bfd41d289a6415c1829447a9462f6730f2654301e9c368b0f01f
    $ curl http://localhost:8000
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is a test page</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    $ docker stop 98f8b9e842e2bfd41d289a6415c1829447a9462f6730f2654301e9c368b0f01f

### The builder architecture

![](https://docs.docker.com/build/images/build-high-level-arch.png)

From <https://docs.docker.com/build/architecture/>.

BuildKit is *very* cool, and I really could write a lot about it here - but
instead you can read about it on <https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/>.

### Dockerfiles, a sumamry

Essentially, a `Dockerfile` is just a text file with newline-separated
commands. Each command "does a thing" to add a new layer to the image.

![](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/images/layers.png)

The most common commands you'll see:
- `FROM` sets the base - this is usually the operating system or language
  you're using.
- `ADD`/`COPY` copies files from the local environment into the builder. You'll
  use this to copy around your source code, and other dependencies.
- `RUN` executes commands in the builder. You'll use this to install
  dependencies, execute build commands, etc.
- `WORKDIR` sets your working directory in the builder. You'll use this to
  change your directory across.
- `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`/`ENV` are hints to the runtime engine that tell it the
  defaults for how to execute your container.

Put together, you can use these to create isolated and reproducible builds!

### Caching

Dockerfiles have a powerful caching mechanism that let you easily re-build
images. This is super useful - a really large build might take minutes or even
hours - and you want to avoid doing that from scratch as much as possible.

The way that Dockerfiles work is that we will only rebuild a layer once the one
before it has changed. So, we want to organize our Dockerfile so that we avoid
changing later layers as much as possible.

For example, let's suppose we're working on a typescript project, that has a
`package.json`:

    $ ls
    main.ts package.json package-lock.json

A naive `Dockerfile` might look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM node
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm build  # builds main.ts into main.js
CMD node main.js
```

But - during development, we'll often be making lots and lots of changes to
`main.ts`. Because of the caching model, everytime we do that, the `COPY` step
will need to re-run, and so we'll have to re-run the install step every time!
A better attempt looks something like:

```dockerfile
FROM node
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json . # this time just grab the package metadata files
RUN npm install
COPY main.ts .
RUN npm build
CMD node main.js
```

Now, everytime we change `main.ts` we just need to rebuild it (and not grab all
the dependencies)!

Sometimes though, it can be hard to split up build steps like this - for
example, if we change our dependencies in `package.json`, we'd have to
re-download *every* one of them, even if only one has been added.

To solve this, we can use a cache-mount for the `RUN` step:

```dockerfile
...
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm install
...
```

Now, everytime we run `npm install`, the contents of the `/root/npm` directory
will be preserved between runs - so any cache that the `npm` command writes
there can be cached.

### Multistage builds

Sometimes, we want to keep our build and runtime environments separately. For
example, if we were compiling a C application, we might initally try something
like:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine
RUN apk add gcc make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN make build
CMD ./app
```

But the problem with this is that we're now including ALL of GCC (our compiler)
in our runtime environment! GCC is pretty *huge*, so we wanna not do that.

For this, we can use a multi-stage build to split up our "compile" step and our
"run" step:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine AS compile # note, we name this FROM now
RUN apk add gcc make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN make build

FROM alpine
COPY --from=compile /app/app /bin/app
CMD /bin/app
```

Only the final stage in the multi-stage build is actually stored and uploaded -
this saves speed and our precious internet bandwidth.

### Moooore

There's so many features to dive into - you can see the full `Dockerfile`
syntax at <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>.

But, one final *really* cool thing - you can build directly from git
repositories. So, to build buildkit itself, you can just:

    $ docker build -t buildkit:local https://github.com/moby/buildkit.git

## 6. Managing containers in production

So, running and deploying containers in production is kinda out of scope for
this talk.

But - generally: often we want to have loads of containers, and have them all
connect and talk to each other in huge networks. A simple tool we can use for
this is called `docker compose`, and is shipped alongside docker.

Here's a simple `docker-compose.yaml` file that takes our web server from before:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```

Now to bring up our container, we just need to run:

    $ docker compose build
    $ docker compose up

We can add all the services we want into here, there's *not really a limit* -
beyond what your computer can handle.

### Orchestration

Generally, this problem of directing how lots of containers should be
configured and run together is called "orchestration".

At the low end, we've got tools like `docker compose`, that can deploy
containers and manage them on a single machine. But often, we'll want to build
and scale applications across a fleet of machines.

For there kind of applications, at this kind of scale, the most popular tool to
use is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It's both known for being
ridiculously powerful, and painfully difficult to manage. *Unless* you really
want to learn it (which you should!) or you are really running into scalability
issues, you probably don't want to use it (but it is *really* fun).

There's also lots of paid offerings that cloud providers offer to easily run
containers without needing something as complex as Kubernetes.
- Google Cloud offers Google Cloud Run
- Amazon Web Services offers... [everything](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1394954440243924993).
  Lambda, ECS and Fargate would be the things to look into.
- Other clouds exist (Azure does not have my thumbs-up though). They probably
  have a way of running containers.

Nowadays, most clouds will also offer managed Kubernetes services, which free
you from *needing to manage the underlying infrastructure*. This is super cool,
you just say how many machines you want in your cluster, or you can scale up
and down as you like (and your wallet allows).

## More resources

The docker docs are a *really* good place to start: <https://docs.docker.com>.
- There are language-specific guides at <https://docs.docker.com/language/> for
  packaging your application using best practices.
- If you're interested in building more complex software, the build guide at
  <https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/> is a good introduction to complex builds.

Also, there are often cool labs out there, I can recommend <https://labs.iximiuz.com>.

Finally, if you hit problems - the [Docker Community Slack](https://dockr.ly/comm-slack)
is responsive, and the maintainers on GitHub are open to bug reports and
patches (seriously, they're cool and very welcoming, definitely a good place to
dive into open source). See:
- For the runtime: <https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>
- For the builder: <https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>

[^1]: Be careful with this lol. VMs and containers *can* be used as security
boundaries, but you do need to be careful. VMs are generally treated as a bit
more secure, since they generally require breaks in the hardware, rather than
software - when isolating at the software level, it's *very* easy to make
critical mistakes (believe me).

[^2]: Yes, I know, alternatives do exist. BSD jails, Windows HCS, etc. Whie
these exist, they're not as well known as Linux containers, which are pretty
much dominant.

[^3]: *So* many alternatives exist. One of the main tools for building container
images, [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) (disclaimer, I'm a
maintainer), supports lots of different backends and there's lots of tooling
built on top of it.
